"Taylor Swift","Same Girl","I'm still wearing my blue jeans
No I don't know what you mean
I'm still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
I've always been the same girl
Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun
I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
I've always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
I've always been the same girl
Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun
I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking...
I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl"
"Taylor Swift","Baby Blue","Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyes
Growing up fast didn't slow her down
American child in her baby blue gown
Her bedroom was pink 'til she turned three
She liked the feel of her baby blue sheets
Neighbors stared at the one horse lie
Of a little girl with blue on her mind
Thought of green when she was feeling blue
American child in her baby blue boots
She was an archangel, sweet danger
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue
Eighteen, small scene
Here, our love was a beauty unseen
Living life young, she'd never get bored
When Hank came around in his beat-up Ford
Prom night came with a blue corsage
Had the car waxed at Ben's Garage
Told her he loved her and meant nothing less
To a baby-blonde girl in a baby blue dress
He reached over and kissed her hand
Five years later came a brand-new, baby blue wedding band
She was a romantic, taking chances
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue
Married two years, Hank was an engineer
She would just stay home, soon-to-be mom
Every night they'd sit on the front porch
Waiting for the brand-new, brand-new baby to come
She was a newcomer, lullaby hummer
Counting her blessings and living for love
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved her new baby, Blue
Her brand-new baby, Blue
Her newborn baby, Blue
Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyes"
"Taylor Swift","Never Fade","I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade
Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade
I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fade"
"Taylor Swift","Fire","Asking you questions is like asking for lies
""Won't happen no more,"" yeah, I've heard that before
Running 'round in circles isn't my game
I tried to make it work but I end up getting burned
By the fire
Leading on life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire
Giving you answers to my trivial heart
It's hard to break the chains
That I can't pull apart
Running 'round in circles ain't nobody's game
I tried to make it work but I keep on getting hurt
By the fire
Leading on life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire
Your flames, oh they're putting me out
The smoke, can't see my way out
The heat, the heartaches
The fog, the blindness
The eyes of cries and shattered lies
Trying to put out your fire
Leading on life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire"
